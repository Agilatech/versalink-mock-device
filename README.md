##VersaLink Mock Sensor device driver

This device driver is specifically designed to be used with the Agilatech VersaLink IOT System.

###Install
```
$> npm install versalink-mock-device
```
OR
```
$> git clone https://github.com/Agilatech/versalink-mock-device versalink-mock-device
```

###Usage
This device driver may be consumed by either the Agilatech VersaLink IOT system, or the
Apigee Zetta system.
```
var zetta = require('zetta');
var mock = require('versalink-mock-device');

zetta()
.use(mock, [options])  // where [options] define operational paramters -- omit to accept defaults
.listen(<port number>)   // where <port number> is the port on which the zetta server should listen
```

####options
_options_ is an object which contains key/value pairs used for driver configuration.

```
"streamPeriod":<period>
Period in milliseconds for broadcast of streaming values

"devicePoll":<period>
Period in milliseconds in which device will be polled
```

####streamPeriod and devicePoll
These options have little applicability for an event-based sensor such as this.  Since this sensor simply updates the monitored variable periodically, it makes little sense to stream the value or poll the device for a new value.  Because of this, it is advisable to **set streamPeriod to 0**, which disables streaming, and set the devicePoll to some arbitrarily large value. Regardless of the setting of these options, the **value** will be updated as generated periodically.

####options example
Here is an example of an options varible which disables streaming and polls the device every hour:
```
const options = {
    "streamPeriod":0, 
    "devicePoll":3600000
}
```

  
####Default values
If not specified in the options object, the program uses the following default values:
* _streamPeriod_ : 10000 (10,000ms or 10 seconds)
* _devicePoll_ : 1000 (1,000ms or 1 second)

    
####&lt;port number&gt;
Agilatech has definied the open port number 1107 as its standard default for IIOT (Industrial Internet Of Things) server application. In practice, most any port above 1024 may be used.


###Example
Using directly in the zetta server, and accepting all defaults:
```
const zetta = require('zetta');
const sensor = require('versalink-mock-device');
zetta().use(sensor).listen(1107);
```

To easily specify some options, simply supply them in an object in the use statement like this:
```
zetta().use(sensor, { "streamPeriod":0, "devicePoll":7200000 });
```
Overrides the defaults to disable streaming and set the device poll to once every 2 hours.

###Properties
All drivers contain the following 4 core properties:
1. **state** : the current state of the device, containing either the value *chron-on* or *chron-off* 
to indicate whether the device is monitoring data isochronally (a predefinied uniform time period of device data query).
2. **id** : the unique id for this device.  This device id is used to subscribe to this device streams.
3. **name** : the given name for this device.
4. **type** : the given type category for this device,  (_sensor_, _actuator_, etc)


####Monitored Properties
In the *on* state, the driver software for this device monitors one value.
1. **value** - param definition

  
####Streaming Properties
For this mock device, it is usual to disable streaming.  However, if it is not disabled, while in the *on* state, the driver software continuously streams this value in isochronal fashion with a period defined by *streamPeriod*. Note that a *streamPeriod* of 0 disables streaming.
1. **value_stream**
  

###State
This device driver has a binary state: __on__ or __off__. When off, no parameter values are streamed or available, and no commands are accepted other than the _turn-on_ transition. When on, the device is operations and accepts all commands.  The initial state is _off_.
  
  
###Transitions
1. **turn-on** : Sets the device state to *on*. When on, the device is operational and accepts all commands. Values are streamed, and the device is polled periodically to keep monitored values up to date.

2. **turn-off** : Sets the device state to *off*, When off, no parameter values are streamed or available, and no commands are accepted other than the _turn-on_ transition.

###Design

This device driver is designed to simulate a general sensor device.  It does this by supplying a random float periodically which acts like a sensor parameter. 


### Hardware

* Beaglebone Black
* Beaglebone Green
* Should also work on Raspberry Pi as well as other Linux SBC
